# TransportRoute_Algorithm

# Problem Statement
If someone has to deliver/export goods, his key priorities are:
  * to utilise as few vehicles as possible and to export as much goods as possible.
  * To transport items via the shortest path possible between locations.

# Proposed Solution
We decided to create an algorithm that will take the weight of the goods to be transported as input and output the minimum number of vehicles required to transport the goods.
Furthermore, by providing the destination, we can easily obtain the shortest route available from the warehouses to that destination, as well as the total travel cost for exporting those goods via that route.

#Project Features
 * Gives minimum number of vehicles.
 * Provides the shortest route from the source to the given destination.Â 
 * We can also transport goods via city on route regardless of the goods to be transported at the final destination.
 * Displays the total cost of travel.
